							<h3>East Coast Brotherhood</h3>
							<p>
								On the East Coast, the East Coast division of the Brotherhood
								established the Citadel, built into and beneath the ruins of
								the Pentagon in Washington, D.C. This faction was led by the
								idealistic Elder Owyn Lyons who decided to make the protection
								of the human inhabitants of the Capital Wasteland from super
								mutants and other threats his top priority, instead of the
								acquisition and preservation of technology. While Lyons was
								officially recognized by the ruling council at Lost Hills as
								the leader of a Brotherhood faction, because of his changed
								priorities he received no support from California and his
								faction, for all intents and purposes, was independent.
								Without reinforcements from the West Coast, Lyons was forced
								to recruit locally, but, as most new wastelander conscripts
								are overeager, unskilled, or both, the survival rate of these
								local members was atrocious. Elder Lyons’ daughter Sarah
								commanded her own elite squad, Lyons' Pride. These soldiers
								help preserve the Capital Wasteland by holding back the super
								mutants, who tend to remain in the urban ruins of Washington,
								D.C.

							<h3>Eastern Brotherhood of Steel</h3>
							<p>
								The splinter faction which lost contact with the Brotherhood
								leadership at Lost Hills has been an independent organization
								since 2197, when the airship of its founders crashed near
								Chicago. Unlike the original, isolationist Brotherhood, the
								Eastern Brotherhood expanded aggressively and eventually
								established a network of bunkers and vassalized towns from
								Illinois to Kansas, drafting folk from tribes and cities under
								Brotherhood protection into its ranks. While more open to the
								outside world, this faction of the Brotherhood is by no means
								altruistic - the villagers under Brotherhood rule, while
								protected from raiders and mutants, live in fear of the
								infamous Brotherhood Inquisitors. The Brotherhood main bases
								were bunkers that were probably pre-Great War military bunkers
								that were found, taken, and rebuilt. In accordance with the
								Brotherhood's military roots, they were renamed Bunkers Alpha,
								Beta, Gamma, Delta and Epsilon.

							<h3>Appalachia Edit</h3>
							<p>
								The Appalachian branch of the Brotherhood of Steel was founded
								when Roger Maxson contacted Lt. Lizzy Taggerdy via satellite.
								The chance meeting led to the earliest branch of the
								Brotherhood being established in the remote region. Based out
								of Camp Venture and later Fort Defiance, the chapter focused
								on recovery and aiding the local population in its early
								years, before focusing entirely on the destruction of the
								scorchbeasts and the Scorched as an existential threat to
								humanity. The chapter failed in its attempt to contain the
								threat, becoming extinct in August 2095, less than twenty
								years after their foundation.

							<h3>Enclave</h3>
							<p>
								The Enclave is a state that developed from continuity of government of the pre-War federal government of the United States, frequently styling itself as the United States of America. Prior to the War, the founders of the Enclave operated as an informal secret organization of the same name. They were comprised of members of the U.S shadow government and military industrial complex. Relative to other human societies throughout the wasteland, it was among the smallest. Control Station Enclave, the single largest concentration of Enclave population in the wasteland, was home to between a hundred and a thousand inhabitants. By comparison, the largest city in the wasteland built from scratch, Shady Sands, is home to 3,000 citizens alone.
								The Enclave exercises control of a number of military bases scattered across the former U.S. However, their primary strongholds were destroyed by various factions throughout the 23rd century, including their headquarters and capital in 2242 and again in 2278

				26.11.2019 - Information.html

				I have decided to create something like that. For the first time i was just looking for an idea for practice and improve development skills and after that the idea has grows as a project with some meaning for me. Why have i decided to build such a site with no-friendly and old-fashioned design? If you know what is Fallout you already know what it is, you can see the similiar design like a terminals, user interface of a Power Armor etc. If you don't, so just Google it.
				By the way who am i? I am not a FrontEnd Developer, now i just learn and try to improve my skills.
				Now i have no idea what kind of content would be on the site. Frankly such a site does not fit for shire amount of ideas. For now i can say for sure what i'm going to do. I just will use it as my note. Maybe sometimes you would see here some useful information (useful for me, if i post it here). So, that's the end of the day and my first post here. Congratulation for me and Good Luck!
