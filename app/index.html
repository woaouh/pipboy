								Fo1 Losthills Entrance Lost Hills government bunker. In
								November, a few weeks later, war refugees arrived at the bunker.
								The people suffered casualties along the way, as while the
								soldiers were protected by T-51 power armor, their families had
								no armor to speak of. Marauders that attacked the caravan
								quickly learned to target the unprotected civilians. Though the
								attackers paid with two lives for every one they took, many were
								lost, including Roger Maxson's wife (but not his teenage son).

							<h3>The Mariposa Rebellion</h3>

								In 2076, the NBC division of West-Tek achieved breakthrough
								results in the Pan-Immunity Virion Project. The United States
								Defense Department, in fear of international espionage, moved a
								military team under the command of Colonel Robert Spindel and
								Captain Roger Maxson onto the site to secure and oversee the
								project, now dubbed the FEV (Forced Evolutionary Virus) project.
								On January 7, 2077, all FEV research was moved to the newly
								constructed Mariposa Military Base to commence testing of the
								virus on human subjects. The security team was transferred to
								the newly constructed base as well, to provide protection for
								the research going on within the facility. They were not
								informed of the nature of the research.

							<h3>Texas Expedition</h3>
							<p>
								After the death of John Maxson, Rhombus, the head of the
								Brotherhood's Paladins, became the new High Elder. After the
								death of the Master, the Brotherhood of Steel helped the other
								human outposts of New California drive the mutant armies away
								with minimal loss of life on both sides of the conflict.
								However, a super mutant faction under the leadership of Attis
								moved east and attempted to recreate the mutant army in Texas
								using the Secret Vault. Rhombus, despite some criticism from
								the ruling council of the West Coast Brotherhood of Steel,
								started a crusade against the still existent threat of the
								super mutant army, now led by Attis. They traveled eastward to
								Texas. There, he discovered a prototype Vault which was
								abandoned and installed the Brotherhood's main base of
								operation in this area. Their principal mission was to
								eradicate the menace of all super mutants. For this reason,
								they created a new Texas Brotherhood icon, which featured a
								pair of wings, topped by dual pistols, all of a red color.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="col-md-6">
							<h3>East Coast Brotherhood</h3>
							<p>
								On the East Coast, the East Coast division of the Brotherhood
								established the Citadel, built into and beneath the ruins of
								the Pentagon in Washington, D.C. This faction was led by the
								idealistic Elder Owyn Lyons who decided to make the protection
								of the human inhabitants of the Capital Wasteland from super
								mutants and other threats his top priority, instead of the
								acquisition and preservation of technology. While Lyons was
								officially recognized by the ruling council at Lost Hills as
								the leader of a Brotherhood faction, because of his changed
								priorities he received no support from California and his
								faction, for all intents and purposes, was independent.
								Without reinforcements from the West Coast, Lyons was forced
								to recruit locally, but, as most new wastelander conscripts
								are overeager, unskilled, or both, the survival rate of these
								local members was atrocious. Elder Lyons’ daughter Sarah
								commanded her own elite squad, Lyons' Pride. These soldiers
								help preserve the Capital Wasteland by holding back the super
								mutants, who tend to remain in the urban ruins of Washington,
								D.C.

							<h3>Eastern Brotherhood of Steel</h3>
							<p>
								The splinter faction which lost contact with the Brotherhood
								leadership at Lost Hills has been an independent organization
								since 2197, when the airship of its founders crashed near
								Chicago. Unlike the original, isolationist Brotherhood, the
								Eastern Brotherhood expanded aggressively and eventually
								established a network of bunkers and vassalized towns from
								Illinois to Kansas, drafting folk from tribes and cities under
								Brotherhood protection into its ranks. While more open to the
								outside world, this faction of the Brotherhood is by no means
								altruistic - the villagers under Brotherhood rule, while
								protected from raiders and mutants, live in fear of the
								infamous Brotherhood Inquisitors. The Brotherhood main bases
								were bunkers that were probably pre-Great War military bunkers
								that were found, taken, and rebuilt. In accordance with the
								Brotherhood's military roots, they were renamed Bunkers Alpha,
								Beta, Gamma, Delta and Epsilon.
							</p>

						<div class="col-md-6">
							<h3>Appalachia Edit</h3>
							<p>
								The Appalachian branch of the Brotherhood of Steel was founded
								when Roger Maxson contacted Lt. Lizzy Taggerdy via satellite.
								The chance meeting led to the earliest branch of the
								Brotherhood being established in the remote region. Based out
								of Camp Venture and later Fort Defiance, the chapter focused
								on recovery and aiding the local population in its early
								years, before focusing entirely on the destruction of the
								scorchbeasts and the Scorched as an existential threat to
								humanity. The chapter failed in its attempt to contain the
								threat, becoming extinct in August 2095, less than twenty
								years after their foundation.
