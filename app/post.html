								Fo1 Losthills Entrance Lost Hills government bunker. In
								November, a few weeks later, war refugees arrived at the bunker.
								The people suffered casualties along the way, as while the
								soldiers were protected by T-51 power armor, their families had
								no armor to speak of. Marauders that attacked the caravan
								quickly learned to target the unprotected civilians. Though the
								attackers paid with two lives for every one they took, many were
								lost, including Roger Maxson's wife (but not his teenage son).
							</p>

								Several soldiers broke off during the Exodus as well, led by Sergeant Dennis Allen. Ignoring warnings from Captain Maxson and defying the group's will, Allen's faction separated from the convoy in order to excavate the remains of the West Tek Research Facility using their power armor. They were never heard from again. Around 2151, the Brotherhood sent out Knights to seek out Allen's group or its remains. All they found were desolate ruins.

						The Exodus survivors claimed the Lost bunker as their own. The refugees expanded and adapted it to fit their own needs, becoming a bastion of technology in a world that has lost centuries of technological development overnight. Maxson also needed to find someone in Appalachia, to gain badly needed answers. Using surviving satellite connections, he reached out across the continent, broadcasting a request for contact. By chance, Maxson found an old friend there, Lieutenant Lizzy Taggerdy of the US Army Rangers. Although initially hesitant to trust him, due to the public declaration of secession, she gambled and left the channel open. As Maxson revealed the depth of atrocities perpetrated by the United States government, Taggerdy's faith in the system was shaken, then dismantled. Following the winter spent at Camp Venture, she joined Maxson's banner.

				I have decided to create something like that. For the first time i was just looking for an idea for practice and improve development skills and after that the idea has grows as a project with some meaning for me. Why have i decided to build such a site with no-friendly and old-fashioned design? If you know what is Fallout you already know what it is, you can see the similiar design like a terminals, user interface of a Power Armor etc. If you don't, so just Google it.
				By the way who am i? I am not a FrontEnd Developer, now i just learn and try to improve my skills.
				Now i have no idea what kind of content would be on the site. Frankly such a site does not fit for shire amount of ideas. For now i can say for sure what i'm going to do. I just will use it as my note. Maybe sometimes you would see here some useful information (useful for me, if i post it here). So, that's the end of the day and my first post here. Congratulation for me and Good Luck!
